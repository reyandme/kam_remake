### ![](Readme/GUI_0310.gif) System requirements

- Microsoft Windows or Linux with Wine;
- any dual-core processor;
- 256MB or more of RAM;
- 3D graphics accelerator OpenGL 1.5 compliant

### ![](Readme/GUI_0303.gif) Installation

1. Obtain the original game (Knights and Merchants: The Peasants Rebellion):
	- Installers from original CD and GOG.com should just work.
	- If you bought TPR from Steam, you need to run TPR at least once, otherwise Remake's installer will be unable to detect it.
	- If you use Linux, see <https://github.com/reyandme/kam_remake/wiki/Game-installation-on-Linux>
1. Run the Remake installer and follow the installation instructions.
1. The KaM Remake uses OpenGL for graphics. In case of visual issues or inability to launch the game, visit your graphics card manufacturer site to get the latest drivers available.
1. Launch the mod - KaM_Remake.exe or from the Desktop/Start Menu if you chose to create shortcuts.

#### Multiplayer
To start a game, go to Multiplayer. You can pick any unused server, if you want to start a new lobby, or you can join an existing lobby.

You can also create a local (LAN) server, using "Create server" button.

If you want to create a new dedicated server for our community, see details here: <https://github.com/reyandme/kam_remake/blob/master/Docs/Readme/technical.md>

#### Keyboard shortcuts
**The following shortcuts are available in the game:**

- **Esc** closes the open message or active tab in the game menu
- **F1-F4** opens corresponding tab in the gameplay menu
- **F5-F8** sets the game speed to x1 / x3 / x6 / x10 (speedup multiplier can be changed in game's XML settings file)
- **F11** will show debugging panel and menu
- **0-9** will select units or houses assigned to with Ctrl + 0-9 keys
- **B** will place a beacon on map, that your allies can hear and see
- **Spacebar** will center the screen on last placed beacon/message
- **P** pauses the game
- Holding the **T** button in multiplayer mode, will show player nicknames over their units
- **Delete** deletes the open message in game
- **←↑→↓** cursor keys will move you around the map

For more detailed information about game shortcuts please visit our Wiki page:  
<https://github.com/reyandme/kam_remake/wiki/Controls>

#### Installing add-on maps:
Maps should be added (in Remake's directory) to Maps (for singleplayer), MapsMP (for multiplayer); there is also a directory for Campaigns.

You can find additional community-made maps at <https://knights-tavern.com>.

#### Adding custom music:
You can put your MP3/OGG files into the Music folder of the KaM Remake, and they will be included into the playlist automatically.

# ![](Readme/GUI_0311.gif) Frequently Asked Questions
**Silent crashes:**  
If the KaM Remake crashes silently during startup, please send the log file to our Discord channel, along with any other information that might be of use.

**Low framerate:**  
If you have ridiculously low framerate in game it might be because your OpenGL drivers are out of date. See the OpenGL version information in the top-left corner of the main menu, it should be at least 1.5.x. If it is less you need to update your graphics card drivers (check your card manufacturers website).

**Game errors:**  
Sometimes when something unexpected happens, you will get an "An error has occurred in the application" message. Please click the "Send Bug Report" button, to send the crash report to us, which will let us acknowledge and fix the issue. Enter your name and email address in the form, if you would like us to be able to contact you about the crash.
