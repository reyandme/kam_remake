MAXID:2

1:Dear lord, the peasants from Lite came here with us and set up a settlement in the neighborhood. They committed to recruiting soldiers on our behalf. We can expect much support from them.
2:We receive soldiers under our command as promised. We must protect allies at all costs if we want to win this battle.
