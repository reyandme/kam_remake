0:Unable to escape by sea the rebels hid in a natural fortress on the cliffs. Break through enemy defense using elite infantry and shooters units, kill all the inhabitants, destroy the buildings and bring justice to all enemies! 
1:Dear king Hermedian, thank you for your help in the rebuild of Ferden. The recent wars did not serve anyone. They were just a craving for those who, despite their status, always wanted more. It is great to be able to travel safely through the boundless lands of our kingdom again. May there always be agreement between our countries.
2:I agree, it is time to join forces and create a real superpower so that no one else can put us at risk. A long road ahead of us but I swear that Ferden will regain its former power finally.
